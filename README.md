1. Introduction
Welcome to FavTracker. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Android application.

2. Information We Collect
We do not collect or transmit any personal information to external servers. All data entered in the app remains stored locally on your device.

The data you enter may include:

Product names, types, manufacturers, comments

Star ratings

Optional photos from your device (gallery or camera)

3. Local Storage
All information is stored exclusively on your device's internal storage. We do not use cloud storage or collect analytics.

You may choose to export your data as a .zip file (which can include JSON + photo files). These files are stored temporarily and shared only when you explicitly initiate an export.

4. Permissions
To function properly, the app may request the following permissions:

Camera Access (optional): To take photos of products.

Storage Access: To read images from your gallery and export data.

These permissions are used only for their core purpose and not for data collection.

5. Data Sharing
Your data is not shared with any third parties. Exporting data is fully user-initiated, and you control the recipients (e.g., via email or cloud apps).

6. Security
We do not store sensitive data. However, we encourage users to avoid entering personal or confidential information in the app.

7. Children's Privacy
